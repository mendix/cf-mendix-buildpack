This folder contains tooling to update the Java cacert file with the file provided by Mozilla. The Oracle and
AdoptOpenJDK versions lack certificates like Staat der Nederlanden and Let's Encrypt. The Mozilla cacert is considered
a save extension to the Java distibuted one.

The original cacert.pem file is located at [https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html).
